  %h2 Russian wedding?
  %p
    Given that we grew up in one country, live in another one and our guests are from ten different countries, we don't feel restricted by any traditions. On the contrary, we feel free to borrow bits and pieces from all over the world.
  %p
    Most of all, we want you to enjoy this day, so we'll do our best to make sure everyone has fun on the day.

  %h2 Car sharing
  %p
    If you have a spare seat in your car or if you need one, email Evgeny, he'll put you in touch with someone.

  %h2 Cameras
  %p
    We kindly ask you to trust our
    %a{:href => "http://www.dashacaffrey.com/"} amazing wedding photographer
    to capture every moment of the day and not to use your own cameras or mobile phones.

  %h2 Parking
  %p
    If you are driving to Dewsall, you may have to park your car outside the premises because the parking space inside is limited.
    This should be generally safe but please be careful.

  %h2 Minicabs
  %p
    We will have a few minicab companies numbers ready if you need a car to get to the hotel.

  %h2 Dresscode
  %p
    We are going to have a countryside wedding, so smart but not too formal attire will be most appropriate.
  
    It's not going to be a very formal wedding, we promise. Evgeny will be not be wearing a tuxedo, and Anna's dress will not have a

    Dewsall is a countryside venue with amazing gardens and meadows around it, so wearing flat shoes (or at least having them with you just in case) will be wise.

  %h2 Stag &amp; Hen
  %p
    We haven't even started thinking about this yet. If you have any ideas, let's have a chat!

  %h2 Food allergies
  %p
    After you RSVP we'll send you a link to a menu, so that you could select your preferences. The menu is extensive, so there will be plenty of delicious dishes to choose from.

  %h2 Children
  %p
    We don't expect our guests to bring children, so there will be no facilities to keep them busy and happy. 

  %h2 Breakfast
  %p
    We don't want to have a heavy lunch after the reception (although light lunch will be served, of course), so please don't skip breakfast on your way to Dewsall.
